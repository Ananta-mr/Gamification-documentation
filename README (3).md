## 4. Creating User Accounts and Profiles

### Step 1: User Registration and Login

- #### Create registration and login forms for users to create accounts and log in.

- #### Use a backend service (e.g., Firebase, Node.js) to handle authentication.


### Step 2: User Profile Page

- #### Create a profile page to display user information and accumulated points.



##




```javascript
function UserProfile() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch user data
    axios.get('/api/user/profile').then(response => setUser(response.data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="profile-page">
      <h1>{user?.name}'s Profile</h1>
      <p>Points: {user?.points}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

```

## 5. 🚀 Implementing the Points System

### Step 1: Points Allocation on Purchase

- #### Modify the purchase function to allocate points to the user's account.


## 


```javascript
function purchaseGame(gameId) {
  axios.post('/api/purchase', { gameId })
    .then(response => {
      // Update user points
      const pointsEarned = response.data.pointsEarned;
      setUser(prevUser => ({ ...prevUser, points: prevUser.points + pointsEarned }));
    });
}

```

### Step 2: Points Display on Game Purchase

#### =>Show the points earned on the purchase confirmation page.


```javascript
function PurchaseConfirmation({ game, pointsEarned }) {
  return (
    <div className="purchase-confirmation">
      <h2>Thank you for purchasing {game.name}!</h2>
      <p>You have earned {pointsEarned} points.</p>
    </div>
  );
}


```


## 6. Displaying Points on User Profiles

- #### Ensure that the user profile page dynamically updates to reflect the current points balance.


```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  axios.get('/api/user/profile').then(response => setUser(response.data));
}, [points]);


```

## 7. Enabling Points Usage for Purchases


### Step 1: Points Redemption

- #### Allow users to redeem points when purchasing games.


```javascript
function redeemPointsForGame(gameId, points) {
  axios.post('/api/redeem', { gameId, points })
    .then(response => {
      // Update user points
      const pointsSpent = response.data.pointsSpent;
      setUser(prevUser => ({ ...prevUser, points: prevUser.points - pointsSpent }));
    });
}

```

### Step 2: Display Points Option During Checkout
- #### Provide an option for users to use their points during the checkout process.


```javascript
function Checkout({ game }) {
  const [usePoints, setUsePoints] = useState(false);

  const handleCheckout = () => {
    if (usePoints) {
      redeemPointsForGame(game.id, user.points);
    } else {
      purchaseGame(game.id);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="checkout-page">
      <h2>Checkout for {game.name}</h2>
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox" checked={usePoints} onChange={() => setUsePoints(!usePoints)} />
        Use points
      </label>
      <button onClick={handleCheckout}>Complete Purchase</button>
    </div>
  );
}


```
